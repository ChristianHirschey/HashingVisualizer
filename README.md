# Hashing Visualizer
React Web Application demonstrating hashing & collision resolution techniques.

## Functionality
Utilizes a random integer generator to generate a queue ranging from 0 to 99 to be inserted into the hash table. Users can switch between linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing with user-input hash functions to understand how the most common collision resolution techniques work.

## Usage
Choose between linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing as the collision resolution technique. Input desired hash function(s) and utilize the "Input Element" button, information box, and grid to see how the hashing logic works and where each value is being placed. When all values are removed from the queue, use the "Reset Queue" button to reset the queue and grid so hashing can be repeated.
